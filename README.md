# 🌟 Transparent Mental Health Referral System

Welcome to a groundbreaking Web3 solution for mental health support! This project builds a decentralized, transparent platform on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It connects victims of trauma, abuse, or mental health challenges to verified counselors globally, ensuring immutable records, trustless verification, and privacy-focused referrals. By leveraging blockchain, we eliminate intermediaries, reduce stigma, and provide verifiable proof of support interactions to foster accountability and accessibility worldwide.

## ✨ Features
🔒 Secure registration for victims and counselors with pseudonymity options  
✅ Decentralized verification of counselors' credentials via community or oracle consensus  
📍 Global matching of victims to counselors based on needs, location, and expertise  
⏰ Immutable logging of referral requests, sessions, and outcomes  
💬 Verified reviews and ratings to build trust and reputation  
💰 Token-based incentives for counselors and optional donations for victims  
🚫 Dispute resolution mechanism to handle issues transparently  
🌐 Privacy-preserving data storage (off-chain hashes for sensitive info)

## 🛠 How It Works
**For Victims**  
- Register anonymously or with basic details using the UserRegistry contract.  
- Submit a referral request with your needs (e.g., trauma type, preferred language) via the ReferralManager.  
- Get matched to verified counselors through the MatchingEngine.  
- Schedule and log sessions immutably with the SessionTracker.  
- Leave a review post-session using the ReviewSystem—your feedback helps the community!  
- Optionally, donate tokens or receive support incentives.

**For Counselors**  
- Register and submit credentials (hashed proofs) to the CounselorVerifier contract.  
- Await verification through decentralized voting or oracle confirmation.  
- Accept referrals from the ReferralManager and conduct sessions.  
- Log session completions for immutable proof and earn rewards via the IncentiveToken.  
- Build your reputation with verified reviews.

**For Verifiers/Community**  
- Participate in governance via the GovernanceDAO to vote on counselor verifications or system updates.  
- Use the DisputeResolver to handle any reported issues fairly.  
- Query any referral or session details transparently on the blockchain.

That's it! A fully transparent ecosystem where mental health support is accessible, verifiable, and free from centralized control.

## 📂 Smart Contracts
This project involves 8 Clarity smart contracts to handle various aspects of the system securely and efficiently. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **UserRegistry.clar**  
   Manages user registrations (victims and counselors) with unique IDs, roles, and basic metadata storage.

2. **CounselorVerifier.clar**  
   Handles submission and verification of counselors' credentials using hashed proofs and multi-signature or oracle-based approval.

3. **ReferralManager.clar**  
   Allows victims to create referral requests and counselors to accept them, storing immutable referral data.

4. **MatchingEngine.clar**  
   Implements logic to match victims with suitable counselors based on criteria like expertise, availability, and geography (using off-chain oracles if needed).

5. **SessionTracker.clar**  
   Logs session details (start/end times, outcomes) immutably, ensuring proof of support without revealing sensitive content.

6. **ReviewSystem.clar**  
   Enables post-session reviews and ratings, tied to verified sessions for authenticity and reputation scoring.

7. **IncentiveToken.clar**  
   A fungible token contract for rewarding counselors, handling donations, and incentivizing participation (e.g., STX or custom tokens).

8. **GovernanceDAO.clar**  
   Facilitates community governance for verifications, disputes, and protocol upgrades through voting mechanisms.

These contracts interact seamlessly—e.g., a referral in ReferralManager triggers a match in MatchingEngine, which then logs in SessionTracker. Deploy them on Stacks for a truly decentralized mental health network!

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Install the Clarity development tools and Stacks wallet.  
2. Deploy the contracts in order (starting with UserRegistry and IncentiveToken).  
3. Interact via the Stacks explorer or build a simple frontend dApp.  
4. Test with sample data: Register a counselor, verify them, submit a victim referral, and complete a session cycle.
